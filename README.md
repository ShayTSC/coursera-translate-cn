A roughly-done coursera subtitle translate greasemonkey plugin

This plugin is modified on the base of lynda subtitle translate plugin by @journey-ad.

It is roughly done, and it is the first time I write a greasemonkey plugin. I will continuesly improve this.

All kinds of optimization is welcome. Pull request fellas.

Again, thanks for the original author, peace and love.
